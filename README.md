# Resume-Builder
Creating a resume builder application using React, Node.js and the OpenAI API.
- I'll be using OpenAI GPT3, ExpressJS, CORS and Nodemon modules for this app.
*ExpressJS is a fast, minimalist framework that provides several features for building web applications in Node.js, 
*CORS is a Node.js  package that allows communication between different domains.
*Nodemon is a Node.js tool that automatically restarts the server after detecting file changes.
